                    <p>This purpose of this assignment is to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon
                        a dataset collected from all of the eye-witness reports of UFO sightings which is having trouble
                        locating specific reports for the data collection is large.</p>
                    <p>With an idea to help people across the world to see this data, we would be loading this
                        information online that enables them to access information based on multiple filters designed
                        with JavaScript, D3.js, HTML and CSS styling.</p>

                            <p>We could observe from our dataset that we have data related to sightings for only 13 days
                                and it is more than 9 years old. (~ 110 sightings). If our dataset had the sightings
                                from last year/month, our analysis patters could have convinced on accuracy parameters
                                more.
                                <p>For instance, when tried to get some recent updates on sightings, I visited a site,
                                    http://ufostalker.com/, which reports more than 5000 sightings in just last year and
                                    around 270 sightings in last month.</p>

                                At the sametime, there could also be a chance of UFO sighting not being accurate for this day being a
                                New Year’s Day and it is much likely that people could have mistook any object shapes
                                with bright lighting as ufo sightings which could have been due to fireworks and
                                lightings.
